Purpose : To create a simple infrastructure using Terraform.
This repository is used to demonstrate the use of Terraform in creating and managing infrastructure on cloud platforms and in this our project we used AWS

objective of this project
Creating a secure VPC environment in AWS using Terraform where an EC2 instance is running an Nginx web server. The EC2 instance should reside within a private subnet and should be accessible to the outside world via a load balancer. Traffic to the EC2 instance should be routed through a NAT gateway.

Files that were created
    data.tf
    provider.tf
    variables.tf
    ec2.tf
    main.tf
    outputs.tf0
    store.tf

####CONCLUSION###
  This is a successfully completed setting up of a VPC and running EC2 instances on your private network and have the Application Load Balancer to route the traffic to the     instances.
i also tested the NGINX server running on the EC2 instance.
